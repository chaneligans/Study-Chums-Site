# Project Description
Study Chums is a web application to better connect students of the same major to come together to study. It will do so by allowing students to sign in through Facebook, who will then search for other students within the same major, and request to connect. If both students request to connect with each other, they will recieve an email containing a link to view their match's profile. Each students' profiles will contain information such as their name and major, as well as a link to their Facebook account. From there, the students will decide whether or not they would like to contact each other.
